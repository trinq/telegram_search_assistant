# Telegram Downloader Bot

A Telegram bot for file downloading automation.

## Installation

- Create a new Telegram bot (https://core.telegram.org/bots) and get its token.
- Edit the `telegram-download-bot.py` file and fill in the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` variable with your bot token.
- Install the `python-telegram-bot` library using `pip install python-telegram-bot`.
- Run the `telegram-download-bot.py` file.

## Usage

- Talk to your new bot and share any file or photo post from a channel with it.
- The bot will download the file or photo to the `downloads` folder in the same directory as the script.
- You can also say "?" to the bot to check how many downloads are waiting in its queue.
- You can say "quit" to stop the bot.
